# Installation

It's pretty easy to start using vue-registrar.  

## Add as dependency
Simply run the following command to install the package:
* Using NPM:
```bash
npm install --save-dev vue-registrar
```
Or manually add `vue-registrar` to `devDependencies` section of your `package.json`

Now you can use either or both of _Component Registrar_ and _Vuex Module Assembler_ features.


## Unit Tests

If you want to test the package _individually_, you need to run:
```bash
npm install
```
And then:
```bash
npm run test
```
